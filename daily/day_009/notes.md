# Day 09: CSV & JSON formats

## What I built
- persisted time series data to CSV
- stored structured profile data in JSON
- reloaded and validated both formats
- added Color for errors

## Key Learnings
- CSV is ideal for tabular data
- JSON is ideal for structed data
- standard formats enable interpoperbility
